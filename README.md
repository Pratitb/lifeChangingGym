Gym Landing Page made using HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox and JavaScript

Fitness centers usually have limited content to show their visitor. A landing would do just fine for them.

So I have created a page with a banner section that immediately attracts the visitor.

Moving forward we have the features section that show what the gym has to offer to their customer.



The last 2 sections are memberships details and a contact form that will help the visitor get in touch with the Gym company.
